Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride. And shit I'm straight. I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave. Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?. I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave. And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name. So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?. Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?. Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria. Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us. Got 20, 000 deep off in the street like we some warriors. My mama told me never bow your head, woo!. . I feel glorious, glorious. Got a chance to start again.
